    <p>Hello I would like to take this time to introduce my self to your Company.
        I Come from a very diversed background I have learned to code although I am not an expert
        in coding I pledge to go far and beyond to satisfiy your Company.
        I have had to make choices that set me apart from the rest I have been on my
        Own since I was fourteen years old I didnt get to finish school.
        <p>I worked for Americorps for a year i dealt with special needs children.
            Part of the agreement to participate in Americorps was that I had to finish my G.E.D.
            I feel like I would make a good part of a team I have learned how to be a team player.
            I also know how to work independantly.
